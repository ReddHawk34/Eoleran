## [[Eoleran/Species/Player Species/Humans\|Humans]]-

After the [[Eoleran/History/Recreation\|Recreation]], the plane-touched peoples of Eoleran were a divided mass. Throughout generations of conflict, they would come to understandings and treaties, and eventually would join cultures together. What is known as Humanity today is simply a conglomeration of the nations of the world that has joined in purpose.  
Humanity may simply be a conglomeration of people and culture, but over time their physicality has been merged into an average. A human is typically shorter than an elf, but bulkier. Taller than a dwarf, but much leaner.
 _///Largely nomadic, the human population of Eoleran is a race once dominated by slavers and captivity. They now rule the steppe and the largest trading hub in the East. Heroes are revered by humanity the world over, eventually some become so renowned they (sacrilegiously by the [[Eoleran/Nations/People/Khoya\|Khoya]]) ascend to godhood._  
_/// perhaps they are simply an average of all of the disparate plane-touched beings.  
The human empire is a result of cooperation and coordination of the various races, and now in the present day, many races seek to separate themselves._

# Plane-touched-

Many of the inhabitants of Eoleran have origins from across all of existence. The majority of those who have influence from these places are generally put into the category of plane-touched. This does not include those who were born into or created from the plane of origin. This category only includes those whose essence influenced the material world so completely that a new being was born.
 
## Fey-touched
- Fey
	- Despair/Longing
	- Past
- Fey-touched:
	- Near-permanent youth
	- 7-9' tall
	- spindly limbs
	- pointy ears
	- large bug-like eyes
The [[Eoleran/Geography/The Planes/Feywild\|Feywild]] represents a [[Eoleran/Culture/Religion/The Emotions/Despair\|Despair]] and longing for the way things once were. This is reflected in the appearance of fey-touched beings by their near permanent young appearance. They stand over 7 feet tall and sometimes reach over 9 ft tall with their long spindly limbs. With earth-tone colored skin and large, translucent, and pointy ears, their large, bug-like eyes make them a very uncanny sight for modern [[Eoleran/Species/Player Species/Humans\|Humans]] to witness.

The modern descendents of the Fey-touched are the [[Eoleran/Nations/People/Khoya\|Khoya]]
 
Many fey that live today do not reside in the largest of settlements and cities of the known world. Like other plane-touched, they typically gather near places where the barrier between this plane and the Feywild is thinnest. The Fey who do venture into larger cities will typically try to mask their imposing size and demeanor. As the tallest of all of the plane-touched beings, they are easy to pick out of a crowd, and often regarded with much wariness.
## Shade-marked
- Shade
	- Anger
	- future
- Shademarked
	- Distorted Shadows
	- Large stature
The [[Eoleran/Geography/The Planes/Shademoor\|Shademoor]] represents [[Eoleran/Culture/Religion/The Emotions/Wrath\|Eoleran/Culture/Religion/The Emotions/Wrath]] at the present. This is reflected in the appearance of Shade-marked beings as being much paler than their counterparts. When strong emotions take over a Shade-marked, their skin glows with the heat of a thousand suns and can threaten to tear apart their very essence. This power can be trained and focused to amplify other skills. With this, many Shade-marked beings have greatly exaggerated proportions, such as a blacksmith goliath having arms the size of Great Mangrove Limbs, or a messenger orc-kin having legs that rival that of the fastest blink dog. 

Modern day descendants of the shade-marked are [Goliaths]

Many shade-marked live among most societies, but reside in the shadow of society at large due to being ostracized for their strange proportions. The average human would consider a Goliath to be unseemly and temperamental. At times they have even been considered too dangerous for society.  

## The Blessed
[[Eoleran/Geography/The Planes/The Heavens\|The Heavens]] represents the desire to feel [[Eoleran/Culture/Religion/The Emotions/Joy\|Joy]], and both the [[Blessed\|Blessed]] and the [[Damned\|Damned]] are strongly associated with a desire to bring others together. The Joy that radiates within those blessed by the celestial realm manifests as a constant hum of heavenly light. This light can be concentrated in any part of one's self, but normally manifests as a glow from their chest representing a contentment within one's heart, or from their head, showing a gratitude for one's position in life. 

Modern day descendants of the Heaven-Blessed are [Aasimar]

Many of the material realm view the heaven-blessed as relics of a bygone age. What once were considered to be angels from above are now relegated to the status of pariah

## The Damned
[[Eoleran/Geography/The Planes/Damnation\|Damnation]] represents the [[Eoleran/Culture/Religion/The Emotions/Fear\|Fear]] and anxiety that wracks all mortals. The [[Damned\|Damned]] are beings heavily influenced by a hellish torment- a fear that shakes their very core. This torment almost always manifests physically. A damned who fears being left alone may sometimes fade from sight when tensions are high. A damned who fears hurting others, may also have a deep desire to eat flesh. 

The modern day descendants of the Damned are [Tieflings]

Most humans have ostracized those who are damned due to their propensity to cause harm to those close to them. There are tales of those who have mastered their demonic influence and now utilize their fears to achieve goals greater than themself. 

## The Curious
[[Eoleran/Geography/The Planes/Quintessence\|Quintessence]] represents [[Eoleran/Culture/Religion/The Emotions/Wonder\|Wonder]] at the great gifts that life presents to mortals. The [[Curious\|Curious]] ones are unassuming in appearance so their being can more fully focus on the world around them and their place within it. Curious ones are more in touch with their own soul than most which seems to promote good fortune for them. 

The modern day descendants of the Curious are [Halflings]

Most humans would welcome the [[Curious\|Curious]] into society, but the curious ones do not often see need to associate with those in large settlements. Deep in the country away from major conflict, communities of [[Curious\|Curious]] ones can be found lounging and gardening to their heart's content. 

## Element
[[Eoleran/Geography/The Planes/Elemental Chaos\|Elemental Chaos]] represents the [[Eoleran/Culture/Religion/The Emotions/Pride\|Pride]] of one's origin and one's accomplishments. The [[Primordial\|Primordial's]] appearance is heavily influenced by their surroundings at their inception. Those born near arid plains may exhibit golden skin and glowing amber eyes, while those born near the sea may have a deep blue skin and have webbed extremities or little hair. Many nascent ones will also take pride in a single craft, and become renowned for it, others exemplify pride by remaining stuck in place like a proverbial boulder on society. 

The Modern day descendants of the Nascent are [Dwarves]

Most [[Nascent\|Nascent]] are welcomed with open arms into civilization as their specialized features and hard-working nature leads to them finding homes in the more industrial focused human civilization of the common era.
