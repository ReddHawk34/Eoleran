#### Background
Eoleran is changing. The oceans are drying up, causing everyone's way of life to be uprooted, and no one knows whether [[Eoleran/Nations/The Empire of Man/The Emperor\|The Emperor]] is alive or not.  [[Eoleran/Nations/The Empire of Man/New Kroy\|New Kroy]], the shining example of [[Eoleran/Nations/The Empire of Man/The Empire of Man\|The Republic]] on the frontier, has been following the shoreline into [[Eoleran/Geography/The Emerald Sea/The Emerald Sea\|The Emerald Sea]] for decades now, taking land and treasure wherever they find it.  

You are in the employ of [[Eoleran/Nations/The Empire of Man/New Kroy University\|The University]] as adventurers braving the untamed former ocean floor hoping to find anthropological artifacts before any of the expansionists from [[Eoleran/Nations/The Empire of Man/The Empire of Man\|The Republic]] trample over them. 

There is a coral forest south of [[Eoleran/Nations/The Empire of Man/New Kroy\|New Kroy]] you believe to be the location of a former [[Eoleran/Species/Merfolk\|Merfolk]] settlement. According to current projections by hydrologists, it's been out of the ocean for nearly a decade now. Relations with the [[Eoleran/Species/Merfolk\|Merfolk]] were always amiable with [[Eoleran/Nations/The Empire of Man/The Empire of Man\|The Republic]], but they were always secretive and there is much to be learned from the recent remnants of their society. 
### Character Options
We will be playing DnD 5e, so feel free to use any character options from either the 2014 or 2024 versions of the game. Any supplemental materials may be used upon review and approval by the DM.

The current list of [[Eoleran/Species/Plane-touched\|Player Species]] contains all approved playable species that would fit for this type of story and setting. We can decide together what features you feel your character would have. We do not have to strictly stay within the books.
